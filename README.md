# passwords-now

After getting my Uber account hacked, and someone using my credit card to purchase several hundred dollars worth of Net-A-Porter, I had my wake up call that using similar passwords across platforms might not be the safest idea. Using random password generator sites solved the problem of spinning up new passwords for different accounts, but I'm impatient. Hence why I made this Chrome extension, so I don't have to open up a new tab anymore to create a new password.

Plus when you've been in React-land for so long, those vanilla JS skills can get a bit rusty ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
